How to add a remote user?

IN order to connect remotely you have to have MySQL bind port: 3306 to your machines IP in my.cnf. Then you have to have created the user in both localhost and '%' wildcard and grant permissions on all DB's as such . See below:

my.cnf

    #Replace xxx with your IP Address, sometimes it has no need to do this
    bind-address        = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

then

    CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';
    CREATE USER 'myuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypass';

Then

    GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';
    GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'myuser'@'%';

Depending on your OS you may have to open port 3306 to allow remote connections.
